## Hello!
So why is it called statusline? 

I am a big fan VIM so this theme was inspired by my custom VIM statusline!
The current colorscheme is called [deep-space.](https://github.com/tyrannicaltoucan/vim-deep-space)

{{< image src="/images/statusline.png" border="solid" color="cyan" style="square" caption="My custom VIM statusline" >}}

Here are other colorschemes available:
* Gruvbox light
* Gruvbox dark

## What was this made with?
